# Capturing Tasks

## It should be easy

Capturing tasks (bringing them into the "in" list) should be fast and offer no
friction. I often see GTD tools where you press a button or select an option in
order to capture a task and it presents you with a screen full of options where
you can add contexts or add it to certain groups and choose a color and all of
that. Although debatable, this is mostly friction. Capturing a task should be
as easy as providing the task's label or name and confirming the operation. It
should be cheap to capture a task, and also cheap to capture a few tasks.

## It should be separate

The slower part of capturing a task (namely, changing its metadata, such as
adding contexts) should usually be separate from capturing it; normally, it
should be done when processing the "in" list, which is commonly done during the
weekly review, a moment you set off some time to beforehand. A somewhat more
rare occurrence is to capture a task during processing. In this case, it makes
sense to have special treatment where one may also add contexts and whatnot to
a task during its creation, as well as choosing which list to create it at.
